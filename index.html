        <p>William Shakespeare (April 1564 - 23 April 1616) was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English.

        including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship.

        <p>We can also make tables using the table tag, the tr tag adds one row to the table, the td tags adds a single cell of dataa to the table, to display the first row as a heading, 
            use th instead of td, to add a border, just add border beside the table tag. The value of border is the border width</p>

        <p>Now let's add CSS to our webpage, CSS is able to change how our content looks whereas HTML changes what our content is. There are three options to adding CSS; inline CSS, 
            internal CSS, and external CSS.</p>
        
            <p style="font-size: 40px">This is inline CSS</p>

            <p>For internal CSS, we have to write it under the head tag, not the body tag. Everything under the p tag has the style applied.</p>

            <p class="external">When there's a lot of HTML and CSS, we create an external CSS file to apply to the HTML file. We link the files under the head tag. In order to add CSS to a particular tag
                we assign class names to the tag and then apply the CSS to that class name in particular.</p>

                <p>Lactose intolerance is caused by a lessened ability or a complete inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in dairy products.[1] 
                    Humans vary in the amount of lactose they can tolerate before symptoms develop.[1] Symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, 
                    flatulence, and nausea.[1] These symptoms typically start thirty minutes to two hours after eating or drinking something containing lactose,[1] 
                    with the severity typically depending on the amount consumed.[1] Lactose intolerance does not cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract.[2] 
                    Lactose intolerance is due to the lack of the enzyme lactase in the small intestines to break lactose down into glucose and galactose.[3] 
                    There are four types: primary, secondary, developmental, and congenital.[1] Primary lactose intolerance occurs as the amount of lactase 
                    declines as people grow up.[1] Secondary lactose intolerance is due to injury to the small intestine. Such injury could be the result of infection, 
                    celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or other diseases.[1][4] Developmental lactose intolerance may occur in premature babies and usually improves 
                    over a short period of time.[1] Congenital lactose intolerance is an extremely rare genetic disorder in which little or no lactase is made from birth.[1] 
                    The reduction of lactase production starts typically in late childhood or early adulthood,[1] but prevalence increases with age.[5] Diagnosis may be 
                    confirmed if symptoms resolve following eliminating lactose from the diet.[1] Other supporting tests include a hydrogen breath test and a stool acidity 
                    test.[1] Other conditions that may produce similar symptoms include irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease.[1] 
                    Lactose intolerance is different from a milk allergy.[1] Management is typically by decreasing the amount of lactose in the diet, taking lactase 
                    supplements, or treating the underlying disease.[1][6] People are typically able to drink at least one cup of milk without developing symptoms, 
                    with greater amounts tolerated if drunk with a meal or throughout the day.[1][7] It is also improved by drinking milks with more natural fat content.
                    Worldwide, around 65% of adults are affected by lactose malabsorption.[5][8] Other mammals usually lose the ability to digest lactose after weaning. 
                    Lactose intolerance is the ancestral state of all humans before the recent evolution of lactase persistence in some cultures, which extends lactose 
                    tolerance into adulthood.[9] Lactase persistence evolved in several populations independently, probably as an adaptation to the domestication of dairy 
                    animals around 10,000 years ago.[10][11] Today the prevalence of lactose tolerance varies widely between regions and ethnic groups.[5] The ability to 
                    digest lactose is most common in people of European descent, and to a lesser extent in some parts of the Middle East and Africa.[5][8] Lactose intolerance 
                    is most common among people of Jewish descent, as well as in many African countries and Arab countries. Traditional food cultures reflect local variations 
                    in tolerance[5] and historically many societies have adapted to low levels of tolerance by making dairy products that contain less lactose than fresh milk.[12] 
                    The medicalization of lactose intolerance as a disorder has been attributed to biases in research history, since most early studies were conducted amongst 
                    populations which are normally tolerant,[9] as well as the cultural and economic importance and impact of milk in countries such as the United States.[13]</p>
